## **Prerequisites**  
Before installing MetronMG, ensure you have the following:  
- A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino-compatible board)  
- Required libraries:  
  - Wire.h  
  - LiquidCrystal_I2C.h  
  - DHT.h  
- A working environment such as the **Arduino IDE**  

## **Installation Steps**  

### **1. Download the Source Code**  
Clone the repository or download the tarball:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BaranGeorgi/MetronMG.git  


2. **Open the Project in Arduino IDE**  
   - Launch Arduino IDE.  
   - Open `MetronMG.ino`.  

3. **Connect the Hardware**  
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the appropriate pins on your Arduino.  
   - If using an LCD display, connect it as well.  

4. **Upload the Code**  
   - Select your board and port from the **Tools** menu.  
   - Click **Upload**.  

5. **Run the Program**  
   - Open the **Serial Monitor** to view distance measurements.  
   - If using an LCD display, check the screen for results.  

## Troubleshooting  
- Ensure all wires are correctly connected.  
- Check that the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.  
- If the LCD doesn't display correctly, adjust the contrast or check the I2C address.  

## Uninstallation  
Simply delete the project folder from your computer.
